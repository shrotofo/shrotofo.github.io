Hey there! 🚀 I'm a second-year Computer Science and Design student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, navigating the wild world of software engineering. I've got this major crush on both software/AI and IoT technology—it's a love story in the making! 💻

When I'm not decoding the secrets of the software universe, you can catch me passionately diving into the realms of animal welfare and healthcare. I'm on a mission to sprinkle some tech magic and make a real impact in these fields. ✨

But wait, there's more to me than just code and circuits! In my free time, you'll find me striking yoga poses, spreading good vibes through volunteering, and, believe it or not, being a detective of sorts in the world of investigative journalism. 🔍

Let's connect and chat tech, yoga, or maybe even swap some investigative stories! 🤓🌍
