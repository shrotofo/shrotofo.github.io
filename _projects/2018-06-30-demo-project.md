### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/S1.png">
	<img src="/images/S2.png">
	<img src="/images/S3.png">
	<img src="/images/S4.png">
	<img src="/images/S5.png">
	<img src="/images/S6.png">
	<img src="/images/S7.png">
	<img src="/images/S8.png">
	<img src="/images/S9.png">
	<img src="/images/S10.png">
</div>
